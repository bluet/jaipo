=head1 SYNOPSIS

Jaipo (宅噗)

This project was starting for Jaiku.com, but now going to support as-much-as-we-can micro-blogging sites.

"Jaiku" pronunced close to "宅窟" in Chinese, which means an area full of computer/internet users, and it really is one of the most popular sites recently. As jaiku is part of google and growing, there're still only few linux client.

Jaipo is a lightweight command line Jaiku Client base on RickMeasham's Net::Jaiku perl module.

Bcoz it's writen in perl, so it can run on any OS and any machine with perl. I got the first feedback that somebody use it on ARM embedded system at May 2008.

Now you can read feeds, send message, and set location with Jaipo.
